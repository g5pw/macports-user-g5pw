description		The SimulAVR program is a simulator for the Atmel AVR family of microcontrollers.
long_description	${description} (ATtiny and ATmega) SimulAVR can be used either standalone or as a remote target for avr-gdb.\
			There is a python- and TCL interface. When used in gdbserver mode, the simulator is used as a back-end so that\
			avr-gdb can be used as a source level debugger for AVR programs. \
			SimulAVR started out as a C based project written by Theodore Roth in 2001. Klaus Rudolph started then in 2004 to\
			rewrite the hardware simulation part in C++. Only the instruction decoder and the avr-gdb interface are mostly copied\
			from the original simulavr sources. This C++ based version was known as simulavrxx until it became feature compatibile\
			with the old simulavr code, then it renamed back to simulavr.
