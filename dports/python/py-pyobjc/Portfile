description         bidirectional bridge between python and Objective C
long_description    The PyObjC project aims to provide a bridge between \
                    the Python and Objective-C programming languages. The \
                    bridge is intended to be fully bidirectional, allowing \
                    the Python programmer to take full advantage of the \
                    power provided by various Objective-C based toolkits \
                    and the Objective-C programmer transparent access to \
                    Python based functionality.
